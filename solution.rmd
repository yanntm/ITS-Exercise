## hanoi.gal

Hanoi uses one variable per ring.
The value of the variable gives the position of the ring : 0 for pole 0, 1 for pole 1...

We have N variables in an array, to represent the N rings.

The smallest ring has index 0, the largest ring has index N-1.

The move transition tries to move a ring with index $r from pole with index $src to a pole with index $dest such that :
* the ring with index $r must be in position $src
* $src and $dest should be different (useless otherwise)
* Then we test, for any other ring with index $o
  * if $o is smaller then the current ring $r, then it should not be on the pole $src or the pole $dest. The abort interrupts the treatment.
* If all conditions are met, we can update the position of the ring to be $dest

So total $N variables with domain {0,1,2}.

## hanoipoles.gal

Hanoi Poles uses one set of $N binary variables per pole (3 bitvectors of size $N).
The value of the variables tells which rings are on the pole. 

To declare these 3*$N variables, we use a single array with size 3*$N.
GAL currently do not support multi-dimensional arrays, but we can think of it as an array [3][$N]. 
The model uses arithmetic on indexes to simulate such an array.

Thus `tab[$i + $N * $pole]` should be read as `tab[$pole][$i]`.

The smallest ring on each pole has index 0, the largest ring has index N-1.

The init transition intializes the system by setting all the bits of pole with index 0 to 1.
These are indexes 0 to $N-1.
This init gadget is used to initialize the array in a parametric way (for loop).

The move transition tries to move a ring with index $r from pole with index $src to a pole with index $dest such that :
* the ring with index $r must be in position $src. This is testing that the $r bit of pole $src is set.
* $src and $dest should be different (useless otherwise)
* Then we test, for any other ring with index $o
  * if $o is smaller then the current ring $r, then it should not be on the pole $src or the pole $dest. These tests qre again testing if q bit is set. The abort interrupts the treatment.
* If all conditions are met, we can update the position of the ring to be $dest. This involves clearing the $r bit of $src and setting the bit $r of $dst

So total 3*$N variables with domain {0,1} + one variable for the init gadget
