## Step 2 : A model

Create a "new->Project->General->Project".

Import the hanoi model into your project.

Right-click then "Run As...->ITS model check".

Compare the two variants, explain how the encodings differ.

Inspect the degeneralized versions of the model in the "work/" folder.

Do they generate the same Kripke structure / State space ?

Increase or decrease the number of rings in the model.

How does the state space size evolve with respect to $N ?

How does the shortest solution path length evolve with $N ?
